# Denison-market-analysis
This survey and analysis is used to discover how big the role of Slayter is when it comes to main meal of day. It is indespensible that Slayter is one of the most common space students go for food and beverage. However, in terms of main meals (which is, on average, students have three main meals a day), besides Slayter, Huffman, Curtis, Granville restaurants, and self-made food are also students’ go-to. After this survey, we hope to gain insight of students’ preference. With the result, we may can help develop Slayter to become a better market in a customer’s need-oriented way. The project is conducted with the help of Milo Dao and Minh Nguyen.
